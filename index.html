    This first week I learned what HTML code is, how I will begin to apply it. I have also learned what a <b>tag</b>  is and how it changes the display and properties of the text I write. I will also learn the differences in thinking and how to apply the processes, like Procedural, Abstract, System, and Technological Empathy. I will also learn to use debugging tools to trouble shoot.
